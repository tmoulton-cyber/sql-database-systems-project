# SQL Database Systems Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the design, implementation, and querying of a
normalized relational database using SQL. The database models a healthcare-style
environment with employees, patients, visits, services, and billing information.

The project was completed as part of CYBR 3153 – Database Systems.

---

## Database Design
The database schema includes multiple related entities, such as:
- Employees
- Patients
- Visits
- Services
- Insurance and self-pay information
- Contact details (phone and email)

Junction tables are used to support many-to-many relationships and preserve
normalization.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Relational database design
- Table creation using SQL DDL
- Data insertion using SQL DML
- Primary and foreign key relationships
- Multi-table joins
- Aggregate queries and sorting

---

## Example Queries
